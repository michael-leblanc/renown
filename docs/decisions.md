# Decisions

Read before planning or building. A decision here wins over any older doc.
When a decision contradicts another doc, fix that doc right away.

## D1 — Godot 4.7 with GDScript, one project for client and server (2026-11-12)
Decision:
- **Engine:** Godot 4, pinned to the 4.7 line (4.7.2-stable when this was written). Editor, builds and tests all use the same version. Upgrading is a new decision.
- **Language:** GDScript only. No C#.
- **Targets:** desktop builds for players. The same Godot project, exported headless for Linux, is the dedicated server. No web build.
- **Network:** server-authoritative. Clients send inputs; the server owns the world state. Godot's built-in high-level multiplayer over ENet (UDP).
- **Tests:** GUT, run headless from `scripts/verify.sh`.
- **Not decided here:** the save format (files or SQLite). It belongs to the server design.

Why: Godot scenes and scripts are plain text that Claude Code can write and review, and the engine already has isometric tilemaps with depth sorting, a map editor, animation, pathfinding and UI.

Rejected:
- **Unity:** the art ships Unity-ready (animations, live gear swap), but its scenes and prefabs are GUID-heavy files an agent can't reliably write or review.
- **Browser (TypeScript):** nothing to install for friends, but we would hand-build everything Godot includes, and 1.2 GB of art is heavy for a browser.

Cost we accept:
- Animations are rebuilt from the PNG grids (the packs' `.anim` and `.controller` files are Unity-only).
- Loot that changes a character's look only works if the Character Creator exports body and gear as separate layers (not checked yet). If it can't, looks come from pre-baked sheets.
